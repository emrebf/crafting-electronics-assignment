This code is a modified version of the "Blink" example in the Arduino Uno library

The flap actuator is meant to make the two "wings" flap up and down with the use of magnets.
These magnets are connected to copper wire soldered to copper tape, where alligator clips
are coonnected. The idea is the Arduino will deliver voltage on and off to the magnets
so that the wings can be repelled by the magnets or "flap".

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(13,LOW);
  delay(1000);
